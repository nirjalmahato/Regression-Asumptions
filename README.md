### Steps i followed to Find the Best Model


1. ** Data Collection **:
- Sourced data from [kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho")
- This dataset contains information about used cars.

- The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

name
year
selling_price
km_driven
fuel
seller_type
transmission
Owner


2. **Data Cleaning**:
- Droped Car_Name column because it contains 98 unique categories, and it can cause high-cardinality
  Over Fitting risk can also be caused.

- Drop rows index [196 ,86] . we droped this rows because it was different from our data we got to know about it from box plot and InterQuartile Rule: 

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
